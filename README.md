   <em>OneDrive indexing powered by CloudFlare Workers</em>
</div>

---

<h5>This project uses CloudFlare Workers to help you deploy and share your OneDrive files for free. This project is largely derived from: <a href="https://github.com/heymind/OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker">onedrive-index-cloudflare-worker</a>, tribute. </h5>

## Function

### üöÄ Feature List

- New "breadcrumbs" navigation bar;
- token credentials are automatically refreshed by Cloudflare Workers and kept in the (free) global KV store;
- Use [Turbolinks¬Æ](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) to implement lazy loading of routes;
- Support for versions of OneDrive operated by 21Vianet;
- Support for SharePoint deployment;

### üóÉÔ∏è directory index display

- A new design style that supports customization: [spencer.css](themes/spencer.css);
- Support for using Emoji as folder icon (if the first character of the folder name is Emoji, this function will be automatically enabled);
- Render `README.md` If the current directory contains this file, use [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) to render the style;
- Support "pagination", there is no limit of 200 items in a directory!

### üìÅ File online preview

- Render the file icon according to the file type, the icon uses [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/);
- Support preview:
   - Plain text: `.txt`.
   - Markdown format text: `.md`, `.mdown`, `.markdown`.
   - Images (Support Medium-style image scaling): `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.gif`.
   - Code highlighting: `.js`, `.py`, `.c`, `.json`...
   - PDF (support lazy loading, loading progress, Chrome built-in PDF reader): `.pdf`.
   - Music: `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.wav`, `.oga`.
   - Video: `.mp4`, `.flv`, `.webm`, `.m3u8`. 

### üîí Private folders

![Private folders](assets/private-folder.png)

We can lock a specific folder (directory) and require authentication to access it. We can write the directories we want to make private folders into the `ENABLE_PATHS` list in the `src/auth/config.js` file. We can also customize the user name `NAME` and password used for authentication, where the authentication password is saved in the `AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variable, which needs to be set using wrangler:

```bash
wrangler secret put AUTH_PASSWORD
# Enter your own authentication password here
```

Please refer to the [next paragraphs](#preparation) for details on how to use wrangler.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Proxy to download files / file direct link access

- [Optional] Proxied download: `?proxied` - Download files via CloudFlare Workers if (1) `proxyDownload` in `config/default.js` is `true`, and (2) using Parameter `?proxied` request file;
- [Optional] Raw file download (direct file access): `?raw` - return the file direct link instead of the preview interface;
- Both parameters can be used together, i.e. `?proxied&raw` and `?raw&proxied` are both valid.

Yes, this means that you can use this project to build a "picture bed", or to build a static file deployment service, such as the following picture link:

## Deployment Guide

_Warning for the stinky and long Chinese (translated) version of the deployment guide! _

### Generate OneDrive API Token

1. Visit this URL to create a new Blade app: [Microsoft Azure App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (normal version of OneDrive) or [Microsoft Azure.cn App registrations]( https://portal.azure.cn/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive 21Vianet version) :

    1. Log in with your Microsoft account, select `New registration`;
    2. Set the name of the Blade app at `Name`, such as `my-onedrive-cf-index`;
    3. Set `Supported account types` to `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`. OneDrive 21Vianet user set to: `Account in any organizational directory (any Azure AD directory - multi-tenant)`;
    4. Set `Redirect URI (optional)` to `Web` (drop-down option box) and `http://localhost` (URL address);
    5. Click `Register`.

    ![](assets/register-app.png)

2. Get your Application (client) ID - `client_id` in the `Overview` panel:

    ![](assets/client-id.png)

3. Open the `Certificates & secrets` panel, click `New client secret`, create a new Client secret called `client_secret`, and set `Expires` to `Never`. Click `Add` and copy `client_secret` the `Value` and save it **(only one chance)**:

    ![](assets/add-client-secret.png)

4. Open the `API permissions` panel, select `Microsoft Graph`, select `Delegated permissions`, and search for the three permissions `offline_access, Files.Read, Files.Read.All`, **select these three permissions, and Click `Add permissions`:**

    ![](assets/add-permissions.png)

    You should successfully enable these three permissions:

    ![](assets/permissions-used.png)

5. Obtain `refresh_token`, and execute the following command on the local machine (need Node.js and npm environment, please refer to [Preparation](#Preparation) for installation and recommended configuration):

    ```sh
    npx @beetcb/ms-graph-cli
    ```

    <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beetcb/ms-graph-cli/master/media/demo.svg" alt="demo gif" width="560px" /></div>

    Choose the appropriate option according to your own situation, and enter a series of token token configurations we obtained above, among which `redirect_url` can be directly set to `http://localhost`. For the specific usage of command line tools, please refer to: [beetcb/ms-graph-cli](https://github.com/beetcb/ms-graph-cli).

6. Finally, create a public shared folder in our OneDrive, such as `/Public`. It is recommended not to share the root directory directly!

Finally, after all this tossing, we should have successfully obtained the following credentials:

- `refresh_token`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_uri`
- `base`: defaults to `/Public`.

_Yes, I know it's troublesome, but this is Microsoft, please understand. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

### Preparation

Fork and then clone or directly clone this warehouse, and install dependencies Node.js, `npm` and `wrangler`.

_It is strongly recommended that you use Node version manager such as [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js and` npm`, so that the `wrangler` we installed globally can install and save configuration files in our user directory, and we will not encounter strange permission problems. _

```sh
# Install CloudFlare Workers official compilation and deployment tool
npm install -g wrangler

# install dependencies using npm
npm install

# Login to CloudFlare account with wrangler
wrangler login

# Use this command to check your login status
wrangler whoami
```

Open <https://dash.cloudflare.com/login>, log in to CloudFlare, create a worker at `Workers` -> `Manage Workers` -> `Create a Worker`, and then look on the right side for your Accound ID.

Modify our [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `name`: is the name of the worker we just created, and our Worker will be published under this domain name by default: `<name>.<worker_subdomain>.workers.dev`;
- `account_id`: our Cloudflare Account ID;

Create a Cloudflare Workers KV bucket called `BUCKET`:

```sh
# create KV bucket
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET"

# ... Alternatively, create a KV bucket that includes preview functionality
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET" --preview
```

The preview function is only used for local testing, and has nothing to do with the image preview function on the page.

Modify `kv_namespaces` in [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `kv_namespaces`: our Cloudflare KV namespace, just replace `id` and/or `preview_id`. _If you don't need the preview function, just remove `preview_id`. _

Modify [`src/config/default.js`](src/config/default.js):

- `client_id`: the OneDrive `client_id` just obtained;
- `base`: the previously created `base` directory;
- If you deploy the regular international version of OneDrive, then ignore the following steps;
- If you are deploying the China version of OneDrive operated by 21Vianet:
   - Modify `accountType` under `type` to `1`;
   - keep `driveType` unchanged;
- If you are deploying a SharePoint service:
   - leave `accountType` unchanged;
   - Modify `type` under `driveType` to `1`;
   - and modify `hostName` and `sitePath` according to your SharePoint service.

Use `wrangler` to add Cloudflare Workers environment variables (see [üîí private folders](#-private-folders) for authentication passwords):

```sh
# Add our refresh_token and client_secret
wrangler secret put REFRESH_TOKEN
# ... and paste our refresh_token here

wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET
# ... and paste our client_secret here

wrangler secret put AUTH_PASSWORD
# ... enter the authentication password we set here
```

### Compile and deploy

Add Required Packages

```
npm install font-awesome-filetypes marked
```

We can then preview the deployment using `wrangler`:

```sh
wrangler dev
```

If all goes well, we can publish the Cloudflare Worker with the following command:

```sh
wrangler publish
```

We can also create a GitHub Actions to automatically publish a new Worker every time `push` to the GitHub repository, for details, refer to: [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

If you want to deploy Cloudflare Worker under your own domain name, please refer to: [How to Setup Cloudflare Workers on a Custom Domain](https://www.andressevilla.com/how-to-setup-cloudflare-workers-on-a-custom-domain/).

## Customization of style and content

- We **should** change the default "landing page", directly modify the HTML of `intro` in [src/folderView.js](src/folderView.js#L51-L56);
- We also **should** change the header of the page, just modify [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L29-L56) directly;
- The style CSS file is located at [themes/spencer.css](themes/spencer.css), you can customize this file according to your own needs, and you also need to update [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L3) commit HASH in the file;
- We can also customize Markdown rendering CSS style, PrismJS code highlighting style, etc.
